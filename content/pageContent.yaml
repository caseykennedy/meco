    aim:
      title: aim
      detail: To find balance within and without and positively impact others through creative experience.

  approach:
    title: Design is<br />problem solving
    lead: approach
    detail: We leave no stone unturned and take a flexible approach to brand and technical descovery. Each project is unique and needs personal evaluation. We focus on bringing vision to reality, minus the fluff. Floating without resistance and in constant motion. Searching for that spark. Action with intention. Our lean setup allows us to work directly and inclusively with our clients to build an ongoing relationship that benefits them as they grow.

  manifesto:
    - We strive to be impeccable with our word. We believe in clear, upfront communication.
    - We're all in this together and doing our best. Don't be a dick.
    - We're in it to win it, we won't take cover when the going gets tough.
    - We work hard, stay playful and never take ourselves too seriously. We're on a planet hurling through space, afterall.
    - We aim to act with awareness and intention and from a center of gratitude.
    - Design is not tequila. It can't make everyone happy.
    - We leave work happy and that's non-negotiable. We will all be dead soon, brands and companies included.
    - We may not be your cup of tea, that's fine. The world will go on :)
